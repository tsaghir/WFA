## Introduction
This is a college project from a program egineering course. We had a task to represent 3-tier architecture in a windows form application. 
We chose a local private medical clinic to build a simple CRUD application. The name of our team was "HouseMed" team and so are the 
names of our projects

## The architecture
We've devided the application into 3 layers and each layer represents a project

HouseMed project represents Presentation layer
HouseMed.BAL project represents Business access layer
HouseMed.DAL project represents Data access layer

## Download the project
To make this application work follow these steps:

1. Download the project in zip format
2. Open the project in Visual Studio
2. Add LoadingScreen.dll as a reference in HouseMed project
